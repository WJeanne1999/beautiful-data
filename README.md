To create a p5.js code illustrating the ratio of big wave to big wave surfers using a custom dataset,
I started by importing the necessary p5.js library and loading my dataset. After preprocessing the data to extract relevant
information such as wave size and surfer category, I calculated the ratio of big wave surfers to total surfers. 
Using this ratio, I defined coordinates on the canvas to represent each data point. 
Employing p5.js functions, I created visual representations, such as circles and colour, 
to distinguish between big wave surfers and waves. Utilizing the Axidraw library, 
I implemented code to translate these visual representations into precise pen movements on paper. 
The resulting plotted graph on the Axidraw reflects the size of big waves in comparison to relevant big wave surfer.
